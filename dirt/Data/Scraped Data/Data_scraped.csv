Monday morning I sold all my RKT for a small loss and threw everything I had at MVIS, doubling my position to 500 shares and averaging down to $11.49.
Today is a good day. LFG.

"They've already lost a bunch of patent infringement cases.  Because these parents aren't enforceable because many of them are bogus.  How many of these parents are actually any good?
Whatever FB settled that case for, it already showed up in BBs earnings.  So, clearly it wasn't very much.  Probably because BB had a weak case and couldn't prove any actual damages.

"The thing is: BB is heavily relied on by the government as they secure 70% of the US government employees; in contrast, CRWD's customer base is mainly small businesses, and its hyper growth is fueled by the pandemic WFH. After 2020, it's natural to expect a NFLX like drop in CRWD's growth; but BB's orders are steady as rocks - governments only pay more on cyber security but never less. BB spent years to create/integrate the best tech and acquire the most important &amp; hardest earned customers, and the rest will be much easier. CRWD's direct sales may look great on paper, but it may fail badly later. Check out how much CRWD's CEO owns the shares.",['BB'],Positive,0.95
"What I'm saying is the drop of growth not the drop of over all subscriptions. But I just wanna point out that BB's customer base has a very good quality &amp; the market is so widely open that BB has its own opportunities to get a sizable share. While it may take more quarters to unfold BB has everything ready to get this part. (From CRWD's investor presentations we know that even w/ the hyper growth mode, CRWD can only get to &lt;10% of the TAM by FY2025 - meaning BB won't see the real competitions here, every player is just competing w/ itself by FY2025, and w/ good product &amp; correct marketing, growth in the cyber sector for BB is NO problem.)",['BB'],Positive,0.95
"I think you underestimate the amount of large companies running CB or CRWD as their EDR, from what I've seen (I've worked in sec for ~12 yrs), everyone uses one or the other (lets say most of the Fortune 100 ). I don't know the gov side well (limited) so I cant really speak to that and I see your point here. Just their market size means they have some dominance there.",['CB'],Positive,0.9

BB is like a massive megaladon under the ocean getting bigger and bigger each day. Boomers can't see it because they don't understand it so they sell. BB is worth at least $20B right now and will be worth over 1T by the end of 2030.,['BB'],Positive,0.95
"I don't disagree that BB could hit 75$ by EOY... BUT there would have to be some big plays that come into force. Patents sold, one of the big tech companies buying BB. It will happen ( $75 ) it's just a question of when.",['BB'],Positive,0.75

Lmao if BB had a monopoly on connected cars and IOT security they'd be making more than $700 million revenue. Secondly Crowdstrike also stopped the solar winds hack. Third... you expect them to jump the monetization of BB per car from $4 to $50 in a couple years? Forth the patents are nearing end of life. Nobody is paying $15 billion for patents that are going to be done in 6 years. Lastly. I personally don't see congress breaking up a $700 million company growing at 6% a year because they have 68% of the EV market and lower %s of the other markets.  Look at  Luxottica and the eyeglass market. All you have to do is have competition and you're fine.,['BB'],Negative,0.3

"Totally awesome, thank you. Original post was a waste of time. 
However, even though you presented some legit info, none of it fucking matters because this is 2021 and BB has meme potential (MP). If you divide MP by EPS and take the square root of go fuck yourself, we might see this thing hit $18 in a matter of weeks on the slightest news. 
I bought about 13,000 shares today at $8.51 because why the fuck not. Join me.",['BB'],Positive,0.8
"Yeah, it certainly has MP, but imo nothing like January will happen again in the near future. So many brand new retailer traders got in on NOK, GME, AMC, BB and got burnt because they got greedy, those traders aren't coming back until they've forgotten the losses they made.
Not to mention the market manipulating fuckery. If they get away with it in january, what's to say they won't just get bolder next time?
Also, I still think legit info and analysis is worthwhile on this sub. Where would we be if DFV didn't put together a fantastic analysis on the fundamentals of GME?
