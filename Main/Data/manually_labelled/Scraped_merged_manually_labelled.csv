Thankkkkk God I didn’t pull the trigger on those puts. Go AMC,['AMC'],positive,1,2021-04-28_11-02-22,https://old.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n00tmd/amc_filed_to_the_secthat_the_vote_to_approve/
"Ah yes 3.5m shares vs 500m shares, it's the same. 
 The point for GME was/is that people feared they might heavily dilute the outstanding shares to gain on the recent increase. I am not up with this, but if shorting is still a point then dilution is a big problem. 3.5 million shares is a drop in a huge bucket and now confirmed for most that the big fear of them doing it couple ten-millions or even hundred millions like here will most likely not happen and they are safe to go.",['GME'],positive,1,2021-04-28_11-02-22,https://old.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n00tmd/amc_filed_to_the_secthat_the_vote_to_approve/
"500m shares would dilute the stock by about 11%. That's almost double the amount it has gone up in the last month. Will the stock price go up? Sure, probably. But all the shares will be worth 11% less. Look at NCLH if you want to see how that effects it. At $30 it's trading at the same intrinsic level as when it was $50",['NCLH'],negative,0,2021-04-28_11-02-22,https://old.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n00tmd/amc_filed_to_the_secthat_the_vote_to_approve/
"They didn’t just lose money last year, their last net positive year was 2018 where they were net positive $110million. 
 They lost $487m in 2017, $149m in 2019 and $4.589 Billion in 2020, source
 In fact AMC lost several times more money in 2020 than they’ve made since their IPO’d in 2006 combined. 
 This isn’t financial advice and I don’t really care what happens with AMC’s share price. I bought a few shares when it was ~$5 in February, still holding a couple for the lulz. But I think it needs to be stated how dire the financial situation for AMC is. They need to execute perfectly and grow massively quickly or their debt will sink them.",['AMC'],negative,0,2021-04-28_11-02-22,https://old.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n00tmd/amc_filed_to_the_secthat_the_vote_to_approve/
"I've said something like this a few weeks back and folks called me a shill. Fundamentally, they haven't changed anything since opening. They're stock price has been going down for a while. Other theaters have less stock out with a higher price. AMC has a lot of stock out there in the wild with the price pretty low. That to me, screams ""help we need money so we're putting out more shares to pay some of our debt""
 Maybe that's just me, it's the reason why I barely interact with this sub",['AMC'],negative,0,2021-04-28_11-02-22,https://old.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n00tmd/amc_filed_to_the_secthat_the_vote_to_approve/

They still have 43 million shares from 2013 they can distribute and are going to do so during the height of the squeeze.

"It doesn't make sense compared to typical dilution. It does give them debt free money that they can keep burning through to try to live long enough for people to be allowed to go back to the movies.

"Pre Pandemic AMC was doing just fine. They grew to be the largest theater company in the United States and then expanded internationally. When Adam took over, AMC was #2 in the U.S. market and didn't have international business. I'd call that steady growth and a solid market share. Also people have been able to go back to the movies in many markets. They're making money again, it's just a matter of time before we all get to go back to the theaters. I don't know about you but I miss watching a new blockbuster with a crowd of people in a kick ass theater. When the entire theater is packed with people laughing, crying and cheering....its an experience you just can't get at home.

"I've recently gotten into dabbling into the stock market amid the @wallstreebets short squeeze momentum and have taken some interest in Well Health, (WELL:TSX) a Canadian company focused on telemedicine and the future of doctors visits and patient care. Given how Covid has affected people's mobility and outlined the shortcomings of patientcare infrastructure when times like these hit, this seems interesting to me. 
 Especially in Canada that has such a heavily funded healthcare system. 
 Anyways, I'm rambling. Here's why i thought the idea has legs. So , Well seemed to be getting shorted pretty heavily as some anonymous blogger named grizzlyreports had put out a short report but it seemed to be written really poorly. Like a 5th grader wrote it, but a very poorly read fifth grader. This raised some flags for me so I did a bit of digging, given that there is a lot of manipulation in the markets by people paying to have campaigns put out like this when they take a large short position in a good company only to make money pushing it down and then own a good company for less when they cover and everyone who had faith in it jumps out. 
 This sounded like what was happening to GME to me but to a company that is on the forefront of patient care. 
 Then I found another site Called the cantech letter (Heres the link https://www.cantechletter.com/2021/04/well-health-short-seller-attack-was-a-set-up-says-andrew-mccreath/) that called out the Anonymous blogger ""Grizzly"" as one of these report writers who gets paid to write these parasitic reports. 
 However, given that the current environment has made the general populous wise to the devious ways of short sellers, I thought that these short sellers were getting squeezed out as the price of the stock was up over 10% the day after the short report came out, and on good Volume too.. over 3M Shares! I thought maybe this was a good opportunity to hop in and maybe ride it up as the shorts get caught naked and the company keeps doing what it’s doing. 
 They recently acquired CRH Medical and raised money and $9.80 Cents in their most recent raise which was above market, so the private investors seem too have faith that they are getting a good deal paying more now for more later. 
 Also well has over 1300 people on its team with very strong EBITDA AND it announced today that JP Morgan upsized their credit facility to 300M up from 200M. 
 All of this seems very positive, very excited to see this develop, what do you all think?
 Would love to hear thoughts!",['GME'],positive,1,2021-04-28_11-15-38,https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mzklc7/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_apr//

"Simply put, Intel is not popular and AMD is. 
 More specifically, though, INTC has been under pressure because it recently posted a significant decline in data center revenue last quarter. Speculation abounds that this loss was because its competitors like AMD have stolen that piece of the market away, which naturally follows if you view AMD more positively than INTC. AMD posted its quarterly and although it only beat earnings estimates by 1 cent per share after dilution, the thing that stood out is that data center sales from them have more than doubled YoY.

 Intel on the other hand has been reporting a loss of 20% in the data center quarter over quarter. They've been losing market in multiple segments. They've made less profit ever since last year and now with the new spending their profit will significantly go down. $2B alone this quarter.

 Neither AMD nor Nvidia is having a shortage.

"Ok retards listen up. Been seeing lots of degens writing small DD pieces of bullish or bearish shit. Y'all need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.
this is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by SEC somehow.
im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates. Im not fucking liable lmao but i am balls deep 125 shares @ 19 average now, its literally all I have on this earth.
TLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin wont affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. 🐻 🌈s mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.
Compulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Basically been seeing posts about ""blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah"". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree so dont expect any bear bloomberg level shit or something
1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.
So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit , so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly 🚀🚀🚀🚀.
THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having ""Digital game exchanging"" or something, image below.
Online trade ins. It says online.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
He also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and 40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/
BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?
Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).
The expected Q3 EPS was -0,84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0,53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.
In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for ~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.
We are still trading at 0,38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.
Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.
GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying ""omnichannel"" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.
Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.
Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.
https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890 this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:
At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.
Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.
So in the heading i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.
​
The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)
The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)
This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:
9.8/2.48 = ~3.95 3.95 * $35.5 = ~$140, The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better.
from statista :
Considering the annual inflation rate in the United States in recent years, a 2.24 percent inflation rate is a very moderate projection.
If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 * 1.0224^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!
I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout ""DigITaL"" or ""BlOCKbuSTER"" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those guys special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10,
Bears are betting against:
Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion
Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april
u/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale
Reggie Fils-Aimé, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo
Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed
Norweigan sovereign wealth fund
Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit
All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears
Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.
​
Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----&gt; Ryan Cohen dies.
2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.
Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.
Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.
This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.
The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:
Concrete short interest as of 31 December 2020: 71 Million.
Estimated short interest, January 11th data: (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : 77 Million
Short shares on loan 7 days ago: 50 Million
Short shares on loan now (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million
% of known float short: 147% as of 31 December 2020
% of know free float on loaned shorts: 108% as of January 11th.
Some guy on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be 200-400% if the numbers are correct. This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.
The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could buy 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was -10%.
Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.
This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated
Need rockets 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀:
Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts ""blockbuster"" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal 54 Million shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?
Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:
This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th
So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from ~21 to ~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M shorted at $17 this shows.
These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.
🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Now for the data for this week:
​
Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop
SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP. BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20,
Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.
Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌.

Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.
You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because no one except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.
Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions
Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:
​
This shows the suspected melvin puts (51000 contracts, 5 Million shares, rolled up from july, strike price $24) and lots of big ITM calls.
🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
This shows the big put contract didnt get rolled over and the big ITM calls got exercised on friday. Large puts are underwater big timem while calls are in the big tendy zone.
These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.
Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).
🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.
Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.
Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.
Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.
Kodak went from $2.16 to $33.2
Volkswagen went from ~200 euro to nearly 1000,
Overstock went from ~$21 to $123
Blue apron went from $2.31 to $18
Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.
$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) $35.5 * 1.0281^77 = $299. GME to moon. 🌑 .
This shit can happen. Hold on.
GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.
​
This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman
Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.
This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.
Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010, Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.
For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme_gang_there_hasnt_been_a_short_squeeze_yet/
IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD
Ihor I quote:
A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move
Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020, He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down ""Short squeeze has happend"" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.
The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.
Edit: You fucking degens just enlightened me that cramer pump is real, funds are ruminating over the long weekend, and stmmy bills pumps stonks and that stimmy bill buys many an xbox. See you at andromeda! Also more rockets.

Edit 4: Amazing post here showing that unlucky prize guy was wrong like I said. Ihor also talked about the hypothecation agreement.
Edit 5: This is true and I forgot to add
from u/luncheonmeat79 via /r/wallstreetbets sent 2 minutes ago There’s also the chance of a ratings upgrade. Moody’s and S&amp;P have GME at B3 and B-, which is rated “highly speculative”. Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).
Edit 6: We are scraping 42 in frankfurt. Granted its low volumes but pre market should open at these prices I think?
Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, 🐻 🌈 posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.",['GME'],positive,1,2021-04-28_11-56-29,https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/

"AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90, I’ve made a previous post about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.
 ​
 Intel struggles
 Last week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be CTO at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)
 ​
 AMD Q4 and FY
 EPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0,47 with a range between 0,43 to 0,58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0,55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.
 ​
 2021&amp;2022 Outlook
 But the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC’s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU’s that can go head to head with NVDA’s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E’s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML’s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.
 ​
 Booming Market
 Finally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.

"That's the ""problem"" (as in it's a good one to have) AMD is strung to TSMC and their capacity / good fortune. People always compare AMD / Intel because they just look at the end product but the pipeline to get there is on different planets, like talking millions vs billions of dollars.

 I've been trying to buy AMD chips and laptops for months, with no luck. Laptop makers aren't developing nearly as many nor as good laptops with AMD, simply due to lack of availabilty of chips.

"I agree, AMD is grossly undervalued at $90 if you're looking at the future. Investors may want some return on their investment now though, and it may not go up right away but it eventually will I think.
 People are quick to point to PE ratio and Intel switching CEOs, so I'll try to tackle this slowly.
 Intel: This is a dinasour. I've said it a million times now. A new CEO is not going to solve the issues magically, and certainly not tomorrow. He used to work at Intel, and he worked at VM (Think Dell level kind of investment) IMO, that isn't a proven record to push Intel out of its problems. The main problem here is a scared cornered board of directors has to act and put this guy in. They're not acting out of innovation, their culture is still toxic, and they still lack talent.
 PE ratio: The current one isn't accurate. They bought Xiling, you need to add that in. Regardless though, you're buying into the future of the company. They have the best hardware AND software. They're competing with two different companies, Nvidia and Intel. People are quick to compare them to only Intel, but forget they make a wide range of products to compete with both. Their CPUs are rolling out in a lot of new laptops, count that in too. People talked about PE when AMD was $30, $50, $70, and now $90,

"I've been in and out of Blackberry since it used to be called ""Research in Motion"". Down at $5, it was probably undervalued. But up here, I'm less sure.
All of the recent move has been with zero tangibly financial news. By that I mean there's no sale, no order, no deal, no merger, no investment.
It's been solely driven by a name drop. And when you look into that name drop, it's a vague partnership with no dollars attached. People are ""discovering"" something that's been known for years: Blackberry writes car software now. Blackberry owns QNX. These are not news to anyone who has followed the,.
The name drop deal sounds like Amazon wants to the third (or fourth?) search engine name on car radio type systems. Instead of apple or Google Car play, drivers can say "" hey Alexa"" to the car instead of through their phone. I don't see that as revolutionary. It seems more like akin to adding an Amazon icon to a desktop. Are they even paying BB for that, and if so, how much? Prior the recent 100%+ mania, the main talk among BB investors was whether or not they should liquidate patents, and which ones. The in-car system markets that fresh new investors are assuming BB will be getting into... they're already in. So the growth potential there might not be as big as some think since it's already captured. And from a macro perspective, when it comes to putting components into a vehicle, every manufacturer pinches their pennies like mad. They go with the lowest bid supplier. If Blackberry tries gouging too much for their in-car systems, they stand a chance of being bumped for someone else who will underbid them. The car makers don't care. It's not like a car buyer can select which system is in their Ford or Toyota. They just buy the vehicle, and whatever screen shows the radio station and backup camera is basically a utility to them.",['BB'],negative,"0,3",2021-04-28_12-06-08,https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0ujm0/is_blackberry_bb_actually_undervalued/

"According to the article, 600m is enough to keep them afloat for 5 more months. The question should really be will we get back to or get higher than pre-covid traffic in theaters within the next 5 months.
 EDIT: This comment was not meant to stir up COVID vaccination discussions, government shut down is right or wrong discussions. It was merely a thought experiment to see whether if AMC can keep operating 1-2, and then 5-10 years from now.
 Anecdotally speaking and in my own personal opinion, no. The industry trend have been shifting to digital delivery of entertainment to the masses over the past few years. Anything I want to watch are either not in the theaters, or already on streaming platforms. Personally, I go to a theater maybe once or twice a year if I really push it? Aside from big blockbuster releases, I rarely see anyone visiting theaters pre-COVID. If anything, COVID accelerated the death of theaters.

"I seriously doubt AMC's business will return to pre-covid levels in 5 months;
 Vaccinations probably won't be done in 5 months.
 Social distancing will probably still be here in 5 months, along with masks, which will limit max capacity and the number of people who want to sit in a room breathing circulated air with strangers for 2 hours. 
 A lot of people learned to love streaming their movies while they were stuck inside.
 Movie theaters were already falling out of popularity with the new generations. 
 Movie theaters have become more expensive and the amenities are not worth the price. Watching a movie in a recliner is not worth 2x the price.

If AMC can hang on, IF they re-invent themselves to somehow compete with the increase in streaming, IF people decide they want to return to theatres.....nevermind....too many IFs for me to make an investment in.

"I think you need to look at this from two perspectives, specially when saying you want whoever gives 4k/60fps first.
 AMD offers two different products here competing against two different companies.
 AMD vs Intel for processors.
 AMD vs Nvidia for graphics.
 As some have said, AMD is kicking butt in the processor game. Their processors are just way more price competitive while still offering like 95% of the single core capability of Intel and destroying them on multi core.
 Graphics cards are another boat though. Yes, AMD has made great graphics cards, but THE NAME in the game is still Nvidia (though I hate their efforts to make things proprietary). Though AMD is hedging at Nvidia pretty hard too...
 Honestly AMD should start manufacturing more PC parts as well, get a RAM and motherboard kit and good to go.",['AMD'],positive,"0,9",2021-04-28_16-35-48,https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzy4qn/never_bet_against_the_doctor/
"Zen3 is faster than Intel now in single core too.
 Their graphics GPUs are actually faster in two most popular resolutions 1080p and 1440p. Only 2% of gamers own a 4k monitor. And many prefer high refresh rate gaming 144hz or more where AMD is now king. Which happens at the lower resolution monitors.
 So for the widest use case AMD has faster GPUs. Nvidia however is still more popular due to 4k crown and some other propriatery features they maketed well.
 But technologically speaking a much smaller AMD is competing and beating the two big guys Intel and Nvidia at their core businesses.. and just this year they are investing in more R&amp;D quite significantly.

"It's really unfortunate that certain community members are using the GME spotlight for self-aggrandizement purposes.
 It's really turned me off r/GME and while I continue to believe in the squeeze dynamics, I am not a fan of these drama-loving karma-farmers who: 1) decide they should unilaterally speak for the community; and 2) decide that they deserve the spotlight.
 The entire GME thesis is about crowd-sourcing information. Placing these drama-lovers on a pedestal weakens the movement as it's far easier for unsavoury characters to influence them to flip, whereas it's impossible to undermine the crowd-sourcing community who check-and-balance one another and offer meaningful peer critiques.

 I guess what saddens me is the only reason theyâ€™re even having board meetings is because we have been giving them hundreds of millions of dollars, not just of money but also of support going to movies driving well out of our way to go to AMC rather than a Cinemark around the corner etc. etc. Itâ€™s fine and dandy he sparing us 500 million for eight months how about we own 80% of that company why donâ€™t we get a say in where those 43 million shares go and when?Why donâ€™t they let the fucking thing squeeze and then they can go on their merry way and they can dilute the shit out of it if they want to. I havenâ€™t received an invitation to a board meeting. As 80% owners we didnâ€™t get any shares after we give them a leg to stand on. I know the CFO, VP, etc. unloaded half of their shares of liquidity guess whoâ€™s money? Yep. Just a little disheartening thatâ€™s all. I am an AMC APE FOR LIFE!ðŸ¦ðŸš€ðŸŒ™ Just SAD!
