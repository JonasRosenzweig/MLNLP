# a labeled tf.data.Dataset object from a set of text files on disk filed into class-specific folders.
# Let's use it to generate the training, validation, and test datasets. The validation and training
# datasets are generated from two subsets of the train directory, with 20% of samples going to the
# validation dataset and 80% going to the training dataset. Before putting the model out into the
# real world however,  it should be retrained using all available training data
# (without creating a validation dataset), so its performance is maximized.
